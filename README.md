Text Based MMO Strategy Empire Building PHP Game
Hi
I am new to coding a text based game. And php in general.
But that won't stop me from trying to create this complex game.
My inspiration comes from playing a few awesome text based mmo strategy empire games
called Galaxy Wars, Moonbase, Zorg Empire, cybernations and a few others.

Marx Warz is set in the year 2160 after humans finally destroyed earth and started colonizing Mars.
Few years later people started arguing as to who should be the ultimate ruler or mars.
Like any human argument, it quickly spiraled out of control just as the birth rate skyrocketed.

Players gets take control one piece of plot as the start of the game.
The need to construct buildings, produce resources and train armies.
Eventually they get to construct or train a unit called an explorer.
The can move the explorer to an "unclaimed plot" I'm which ever area or zone
by looking at their radar page.
Once they claim that plot, the explorer disappears and the plot gets added to the users other plots.
Each user can have a total of 15 plots.
Each new plot discovered will work the same,have the same buildings and etc. They player will need to upgrade them all.
Players can attack, raid and defend from attacks from other players which then will points will be added to the leaderboard.
Raider points you get when you raid or loot resources from other players.
Attacker points you get if you successfully attack another player and kill their defending armies.
Defender points you get when you successfully defend against an attack.
Each week the leaderboard resets and they top players will get a medal.
Players will also be able to create an alliance with other players. 
Each alliance can hold up to 100 other players.
I will work on alliance feature later in the game.

The buildings each players base or plot will be the following.

Buildings:
Lead mine - max level of 20. Produces 13000 lead per hour at maxed level.
Metal mine - max level of 20. Produces 13000 Metal per hour at maxed level.
Oil well - max level of 20 produces 13000 Oil per hour at maxed level.
Coal mine - maxed level 30 prodeces 70000 Coal per hour at maxed level.
Lead store - maxed level 50. Stores 560 000 lead at maxed level.
Metal store - maxed level 50. Stores 560 000 Metal at maxed level.
Oil silo - maxed level 50. Stores 560 000 Oil at maxed level.
Coal store - maxed level 50. Stores 560 000 Coal at maxed level.
Radar - maxed level 15. Each level gives access to an additional 50 areas.
Research - maxed level 20. Each level allows the user user to research unit movement speed and unit production speed.
Military base - Maxed level 20 upgrade each level will unlock a new military unit.
Shield - level 10 will act as a defense to defend against player bombing and destroyed buildings.

Each upgrade they do on each building level. Will add 20 population per level. The population will be added to the players total population.
When a player bombs another players building. For each level that is lost on that building. It looses 20 population and it will show next to the defending players current pop in negative.

There will be a chat feature aswell that sort of acts as a global chat for all players to chat to each other. 
The military units will be trained or built in the military base building page.
